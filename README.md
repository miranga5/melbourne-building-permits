# Victoria Building Permits Analysis üèóÔ∏è

This project explores building permit data across Victoria, Australia, with a focus on uncovering patterns in construction activity, costs, and urban development.  
Using Python and geospatial analysis, the project demonstrates how raw permit data can be transformed into meaningful insights through visualization, clustering, and mapping.

## üîç Project Highlights
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, transforming, and enriching raw permit datasets with suburb, postcode, and state details.  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Identifying the most expensive projects and suburbs by cost and activity.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Choropleth maps showing permit activity and costs across Victoria.  
  - Bar charts highlighting top suburbs and projects.  
  - KMeans clustering of suburbs by number of permits and average costs.  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Integration with GeoJSON boundaries to display insights geographically.  
- **Top 1% Projects:** Spotlighting high-value projects with detailed data (address, permit type, estimated costs, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated
- **Python for Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, folium  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: geopandas, folium choropleths  
- **Machine Learning**: KMeans clustering with scikit-learn  
- **Data Storytelling**: Converting raw numeric data into intuitive, map-driven narratives

## üìä Example Insights
- The **top 20 suburbs** account for a significant share of building investment.  
- Some projects exceed **billions of AUD** in estimated cost.  
- Clustering reveals distinct suburban profiles: high-cost, high-volume vs. low-cost, low-volume areas.
